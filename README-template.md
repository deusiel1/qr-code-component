## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS variables
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned to declare `display: flex` twice. I didn't know that. I also used relative units instead of pixels wich helped with responsiveness.


### Continued development

I need to improve my ability to deal with units. At the beginning i sttrugled a litle because I was using percentages instead of rem's. After this change I was able to finish the project. I also didn't use any media queries because from my perspective it looks good on both mobiel and desktop version.
